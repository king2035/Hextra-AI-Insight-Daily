Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "this site" or "we")! 🎉 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using this site, you're signaling your agreement and acceptance of these terms.

## 1. Service Overview

**This site** provides users with paid subscription content and membership services, including but not limited to blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is exclusively for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account! 🙅‍♀️
- **This site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are processed securely through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, this site doesn't store your payment info.
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't forget!
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and let us know why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund, so choose wisely! 😉 After 14 days, or for any non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless legally required.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up!
- If content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions, **this site** **won't be liable for compensation**. Bummer, we know.
