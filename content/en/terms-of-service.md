# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the site" or "we")! 👋 Before you dive in, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our site, you're giving us a nod that you agree to and accept these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
What's the lowdown? **Our site hooks users up with paid subscription content and exclusive member services.** This includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, members-only resources, cool e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this good stuff is only for our subscribed users! 😉

## 2. User Registration and Account
- First things first: **users gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password** to get their account registered.
- Heads up! **Users are totally responsible for keeping their accounts secure and for all the happenings there.** And seriously, trying to transfer or share accounts? That's a big no-no! 🚫
- Just so you know: **we reserve the right to hit the pause button or even pull the plug on user accounts** if folks don't play by these rules.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- About the moolah: **subscription services are billed monthly or annually**, and you'll see all the deets on the checkout page.
- Good news for your wallet! **All payments zoom through secure third-party platforms** (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't sweat it, we don't stash your payment info.
- Heads up again: **your subscriptions will totally auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up. So keep an eye on that! 👀
- Our awesome **14-day refund policy**? It's specially for first-time subscribers! If you're not absolutely thrilled with the service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the email at the bottom of these terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this, so make it count! After 14 days, or for any repeat subscriptions, payments are a solid **non-refundable** deal, unless the law says otherwise. No wiggle room there! 💸

## 4. Content Usage and Intellectual Property
- Quick scoop on content: **all original content here is copyrighted by us (hubtoday).** Please don't go copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our say-so. That's a no-go!
- When you join, **users snag non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights** – strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- Need to use something for commercial purposes or quote us big-time? **For commercial use or extensive citation, just give us a shout** to get the green light.

## 5. User Conduct Policy
- Listen up: **it's a big no-no to upload, publish, or spread** any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it cool, alright? 😎
- Also, a strict **prohibition against mass downloading, crawling, or cracking member content** using any tech tricks. Don't even try it! 🙅‍♀️
- Here's the deal: **we totally reserve the right to yank any inappropriate content and give violating users the boot!** 👢

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- Heads-up about the service: **we reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services** whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up beforehand.
- Bad news, but sometimes stuff happens: **we're not on the hook for compensation** if content is temporarily out of reach due to things like an act of God, a server hiccup, or if a third-party service flakes out on us. Bummer, we know! 😞

## 7. Disclaimer
- Quick note on advice: **the info we dish out on our site is just for reference.** It's definitely **not** meant to be professional advice (like for your finances, legal stuff, or health). Always chat with a pro for that! 🧠
- Just clarifying: **we're not responsible for any direct or indirect losses** you might run into from using our content or services. So, heads up and proceed with care!

## 8. Governing Law
- Getting legal for a sec: **these Terms of Service are all cozy with and interpreted by the laws of the State of California, United States,** ignoring any pesky conflict of law principles.
- If things get sticky: **any disputes popping up from or related to these Terms** should first try to be sorted out with a friendly chat. If that doesn't fly, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it. Game on! ⚖️
