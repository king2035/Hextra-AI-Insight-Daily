# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "yes, I agree" to these terms. 😎

## 1. Service Overview
Our services are all about providing users with awesome paid subscription content and exclusive membership perks. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, unique resources, e-books, community interaction, and more! Just a heads-up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration and Account
- To register an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Users are solely responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Seriously, don't** transfer or share your account!
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** any user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't worry, we don't store your payment info! 🔒
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before the end of your current billing cycle.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally thrilled with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just reach out to us via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and let us know why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required. No hard feelings! 😉

## 4. Content Usage and Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. You absolutely cannot copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization.
- Users are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** the content for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library card! 📚
- If you're looking to use our content for commercial purposes or need to quote extensively, please reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Do NOT** upload, post, or spread any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Seriously, don't! 🚫
- It's strictly **prohibited** to use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack our member-exclusive content. That's a no-go!
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any violating users**. Consider this your fair warning.

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
- If content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **will not be liable for compensation**. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided on this Site is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any form of professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). Always consult a pro for that! 🧑‍⚕️⚖️💰
- The Site **will not be held responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to the use of its content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and resolve them through friendly negotiation. If negotiations hit a snag, you agree to submit the dispute to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.
