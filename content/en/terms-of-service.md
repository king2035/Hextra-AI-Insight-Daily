# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to herein as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using this Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms. It's super important we're all on the same page!

## 1. About Our Services
**Our services** hook you up with paid subscription content and membership perks, like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Just a heads-up: some awesome content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **To get your account set up**, you'll need to provide a valid email address and pick a password.
- **Users** are fully responsible for their account's security and everything that happens on it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** accounts — that's a big no-no!
- **We** can **suspend or even terminate** accounts if users don't play by these Terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the fees crystal clear on the checkout page.
- **All payments** zip through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). And chill, we never store your payment info!
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew**, so if you're planning to bail, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is exclusively for first-time subscribers: if you're not completely satisfied with the service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just reach out to us via the contact email provided at the end of these Terms and explain your reason for the refund. Each user gets one refund opportunity, no exceptions. Beyond 14 days or for repeat subscriptions, please note: **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless legally required.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All our original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off, unless you've got our permission to copy, reproduce, or use it commercially!
- **Users** just get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass** to access content for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library card!
- **For any commercial use** or if you want to quote us a lot, please hit us up for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's a big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights.
- **And definitely don't** try to mass download, crawl, or hack our membership content with any tech tricks.
- **We** can totally yank inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Play fair, folks!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, pause, or ditch any part or all of our services anytime, without giving you a heads-up.
- **The Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if content goes dark temporarily because of things like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Life happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info we provide** is just for kicks and giggles — it **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always check with a pro!
- **The Site** is absolutely **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Use at your own risk!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are super serious and are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, ignoring any conflicts of law stuff.
- **Got a dispute** related to these Terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Game on!
