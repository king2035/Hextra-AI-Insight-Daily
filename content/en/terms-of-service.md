# Service Terms

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "us"). Before diving into what we offer, take a moment to carefully read these Service Terms. By using or even just checking out the Site, you're cool with and agree to these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
The Site provides users with paid subscription content and membership services. These awesome services include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are solely responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no** transferring or sharing your account.
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly shown on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). The Site does not store your payment information – pretty sweet, right?
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before the end of the current billing cycle.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers, if you're not totally satisfied with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and spill the beans on why you're requesting a refund. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless legally required.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal, folks! 😉
- For commercial use or extensive citations, please reach out to the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice!
- **No, seriously, don't** attempt to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content using technical means.
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. Consider this your fair warning! 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just giving you the heads-up now!
- The Site **won't be held liable** for any damages if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided on the Site is strictly for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical – we're not pros in those fields!).
- The Site **is not responsible or liable** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Service Terms are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms? Both parties should first try to hash things out amicably. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
