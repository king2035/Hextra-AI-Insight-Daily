# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** is your go-to spot for paid subscription content and membership services! This cool stuff includes (but isn't limited to) blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interaction. Just a heads-up: some content is only for our subscribed members. 🔐

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **User Accounts** require you to provide a valid email address and set up a password to get registered.
- You're totally responsible for your account's security and everything that happens under it. So, **NO** transferring or sharing your account, alright?
- If you mess up and violate these terms, **the Site** has the right to suspend or even terminate your account. Bummer!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with all costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are handled securely through third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal). Don't sweat it, **the Site** never stores your payment info. 🛡️
- Your **subscription will automatically renew**, unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet for first-time subscribers! If you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: each user gets only one refund chance. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, **we generally don't offer refunds** after payment, unless the law absolutely says we have to.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is copyrighted by **the Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our say-so is a definite no-go. 🚫
- **Users** get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access right, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it chill!
- For any commercial use or if you want to quote extensively, please reach out to **the Site** for authorization. We're usually pretty friendly! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a big **NO-NO** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't be that person.
- Also, **don't even think about** using tech tricks to mass download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and, yep, **ban violating users**. You've been warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** keep the right to change, suspend, or totally terminate any or all services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just how it goes sometimes!
- If stuff happens like "acts of God," server meltdowns, or third-party service hiccups making content temporarily unreachable, **the Site** won't be held responsible for compensation.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info** provided by **the Site** is purely for reference. It **does NOT constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). So, don't take it as gospel for big decisions, okay?
- **The Site** is **NOT liable** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are totally governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA. We're not even gonna think about those pesky conflict of law principles.
- For any beefs or disputes arising from or related to these terms, **both parties** gotta promise to try and sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't fly, then **you** agree to take it to the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California.
