# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter "this site" or "we")! Before diving into our services, please make sure to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using this site, you're essentially saying 'I agree!' to everything here.

## 1. Service Overview
**Our services** offer users a treasure trove of paid subscription content and exclusive membership perks. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, unique resources, e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of these goodies are only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** are required to register an account by providing a valid email address and setting up a password.
*   **Your account** is your responsibility! You're accountable for its security and everything that happens under it. Absolutely no transferring or sharing, folks!
*   **We** reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts if users decide to breach these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, with all fees transparently displayed on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** are securely handled via third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Just so you know, we absolutely do *not* store your payment info.
*   **Subscriptions** will automatically renew unless you decide to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-timer and not totally thrilled with your subscription, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. If it's been over 14 days, or you're not a first-time subscriber, payments are generally non-refundable, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** here is copyrighted by us (hubtoday). That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial gigs without our explicit say-so!
*   **Your access** to our content is strictly non-exclusive and non-transferable, intended purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
*   **If you need to** use our content for commercial purposes or cite it extensively, please get in touch with us first for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **You** are absolutely forbidden from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it clean! 🚫
*   **Using technical means** to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content? Yeah, that's a big no-no. 🙅‍♂️
*   **We** reserve the right to yank any inappropriate content and give violating users the boot! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** might change, suspend, or even axe some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just wanted to let you know! 🤷‍♀️
*   **We** won't be on the hook for any compensation if content goes temporarily offline because of stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information provided by this site** is purely for reference. Consider it more of a friendly guide, definitely *not* professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff).
*   **We** are absolutely not responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just a heads-up!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without fussing over conflict of law principles.
*   **Any disputes** stemming from or related to these terms? Let's try to hash them out amicably first. If that doesn't work, you're cool with bringing it to the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California. ⚖️
