# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "this site" or "we"). Before you dive into our awesome services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By hopping on or using our site, you're basically saying 'Yep, I agree!' to these terms. Let's get started!

## 1. About Our Services
**This site** is all about hooking you up with paid subscription content and super cool member services. We're talking blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community vibes, just to name a few. Keep in mind, some of our juiciest content is exclusively for our subscribed peeps. 😉

## 2. Your Account & Registration
*   **Users** need to drop a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
*   **You**, as the user, are totally on the hook for your account's security and everything that happens under it. Sharing or transferring your account? That's a big no-no. 🙅‍♀️
*   **This site** holds the right to hit pause or even terminate your account if you ever go against these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Deets
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact cost super clear on the checkout page. No surprises!
*   **Payments** are all handled through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. FYI, we don't store any of your payment info ourselves. Your deets are safe.
*   **Subscriptions** will automatically renew themselves. So, if you wanna stop the magic, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is here for first-time subscribers! If you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of buying, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (find it at the bottom of these terms) and tell us what's up. Heads-up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are usually non-refundable, unless the law steps in and says otherwise.

## 4. Content & Your Rights
*   **All original content** on this site is copyrighted by us (hubtoday). So, please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without our permission. 🙏
*   **Users** get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass just for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library card!
*   For **commercial use or if you want to quote a lot** of our stuff, just hit us up to get the green light.

## 5. User Conduct – Play Nice!
*   **You are strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading anything illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or anything that messes with other people's rights. Let's keep it positive!
*   **Don't even think about** bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to hack into our member content using technical tricks. Seriously, don't.
*   **This site** has the power to yank any inappropriate content and give violating users the boot. 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Downtime
*   **We** might change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services anytime, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes.
*   **This site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if our content becomes temporarily unavailable because of things like force majeure, server glitches, or if a third-party service flakes out. It happens! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Our Disclaimer (The Fine Print)
*   **The info this site provides** is purely for reference. It's definitely not professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so don't take it as such!
*   **This site** won't be responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. The Legal Stuff (Governing Law)
*   **These Terms of Service** are all governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, United States. We're keeping it simple and not diving into those tricky conflict-of-law principles.
*   **Any disputes** that pop up from or relate to these terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it.
