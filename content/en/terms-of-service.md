# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "the Site" or "we" from here on out). These Terms of Service are super important and they govern how you use our Site. By jumping in and using our services, you're totally agreeing to these terms. So, seriously, give them a good read before you get started! 👀

## 1. Service Introduction
So, what's the deal here? **The Site** hooks you up with some awesome paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and a lively community to chat in. Just a heads-up, though: some of the extra special stuff is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To get an account, **you'll need** to set up a password and give us a valid email address.
- Heads up, **your account** security is totally on you, and so are all the activities happening with it. And hey, **transferring or sharing accounts**? That's a big **NO-GO** 🚫.
- If **anyone** breaks these Terms, **the Site** has the right to **pause or even close** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our **subscription services** are billed monthly or annually. Don't worry, **all the fees** will be super clear on the checkout page before you commit.
- Just so you know, **all payments** go through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We never, ever store your payment info ourselves – your security is key! 🔐
- Good to know: **subscriptions** usually **auto-renew**. So, if you want to stop, make sure to cancel before your current billing period ends.
- Got cold feet? No worries! Our **14-Day Refund Policy** has your back. **First-time subscribers** can snag a full refund if you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of buying. Just hit us up at the email at the bottom of these Terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this, though! After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, **payments** are generally **non-refundable** unless the law explicitly says otherwise. Fair is fair! 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- Listen up: **all the original content** here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means **no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff** – seriously, it's against the rules! 🚫
- As a **user**, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass** to check out our content for your *personal* learning and reading. Keep it chill, keep it personal.
- If you're thinking **commercial use or quoting a bunch**, you'll need to hit up **the Site** first for permission. Don't be shy!

## 5. User Conduct Policy
- Let's keep things civil. **Uploading, posting, or sharing anything** that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on someone else's rights **is a hard no** 🚫.
- And hey, **bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack our membership content using tech tricks**? Also a major no-no! 🙅‍♂️
- **The Site** isn't shy about taking down nasty content and **booting users** who don't play by the rules. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Heads up: **we** might change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever, and we don't always give a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls! 🤷‍♀️
- If stuff goes wonky – like act of God, server crashes, or third-party hiccups making content temporarily unavailable – **the Site** **can't be held responsible for compensation**. It's just one of those things!

## 7. Disclaimer
- Just a friendly reminder: **any info from the Site** is just for kicks and giggles (or, you know, reference 😉). It's **not professional advice** – so don't take it as financial, legal, or medical gospel!
- And seriously, **the Site** **won't be on the hook for any direct or indirect losses** you might run into from using our content or services. Use your best judgment!

## 8. Governing Law
- Alright, legal talk time! **These Terms of Service** are governed by and will be interpreted according to the laws of California, USA. We're skipping all those pesky conflict-of-law principles.
- Got a beef? **Any disagreements** about these Terms? First, let's try to hash it out nicely, just the two of us. If we can't sort it out, **you** agree that we'll take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal?
