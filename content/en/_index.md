### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Re-TRAC helps agents remember failures.**
    The Re-TRAC (Recursive Trajectory Compression) framework, proposed by Microsoft and Southeast University, helps agents remember failures by passing search experiences across turns 🧠. Its 4B model achieves SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks, with the 30B version even surpassing the 358B-parameter GLM 💪. The [paper is publicly available (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02486), and the code is on [GitHub (AI News)](https://github.com/microsoft/InfoAgent).

2.  **Co-rewarding tackles unlabelled RL collapse.**
    A new self-supervised RL framework, Co-rewarding, has been proposed by teams from Hong Kong Baptist University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University 🔥. This framework uses complementary perspective supervision to effectively prevent reward speculation and enables stable training without requiring real answer labels. It achieved an average improvement of **+12.90%** on mathematical benchmarks. This work has been [accepted by ICLR 2026 (AI News)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fDk95XPsCU).

3.  **CAFE uses causal discovery to guide feature engineering.**
    A new paper introduces CAFE (Causal-guided Automatic Feature Engineering), a framework that guides feature engineering through causal discovery ✨. It combines causal graphs with multi-agent deep Q-learning, achieving up to a 7% performance improvement on 15 benchmarks and reducing performance decay by approximately 4x under distribution shifts. See the [full paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16435) for details.

4.  **Continual learning no longer fears forgetting.**
    Researchers are challenging the traditional continual learning paradigm, suggesting that when memory is sufficient, the core problem becomes a lack of plasticity. They propose a weight space merging method 🛠️ to restore learning capability, which has proven effective in both image classification and LLM fine-tuning. The [paper details (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07274) have been updated to v5.

5.  **What knowledge do generative social robots need?**
    Research explores the knowledge requirements for generative social robot design 🤖 in university settings. Through 12 interviews, three categories of knowledge needs were identified: self-knowledge, user knowledge, and contextual knowledge. This work aims to make LLM-driven robots more responsible. The [paper address (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12873) is now public.

### Industry Outlook & Societal Impact

1.  **OpenAI quietly removes safety mission.**
    OpenAI has quietly removed its safety mission from its tax documents 💀, eliminating 'safety' and 'not constrained by profit' from its mission statement. Employee Peter Girnus satirized the company's 'seven deadly sins' in a post, while the mission alignment team has been disbanded, with its head now serving as 'Chief Futurist.' The [controversy continues to ferment (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-19-2).

2.  **Li Feifei's World Labs secures $1B funding.**
    Li Feifei's World Labs, a spatial intelligence company, has seen its valuation soar to an astonishing **$5 billion**, securing $1 billion in funding 💰. Tech giants like AMD, Nvidia, and Fidelity are all onboard. Its valuation has quintupled in less than two years—that's impressive speed! Its first product, **Marble**, is already the most advanced 3D world model. [Li Feifei interview details (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/02/381378.html) offer a wealth of information.

3.  **Fake webpage fools ChatGPT and Google.**
    A fake webpage, where an author fabricated information about a hot dog champion 🌭 on their personal website, successfully tricked both ChatGPT and Google into outputting it as fact. This exposed a significant **source trust gap** in RAG retrieval. The community is now calling for a claim-by-claim verification mechanism. The [discussion details (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47072450) have sparked widespread controversy.

4.  **X platform's algorithm reshapes political landscape.**
    X platform's recommendation algorithm is reshaping the political landscape, according to new research 📊. The study reveals how it influences users' political attitudes, noting that many left-leaning users migrated after Musk's acquisition. **Paid blue checkmark** replies are also drowning out valuable discussions. Commentators are calling for open protocols and algorithm transparency. [Nature related research (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47065728) has been cited multiple times.

5.  **AI acceleration might worsen technical debt.**
    AI's accelerating pace might be worsening technical debt, warns Martin Fowler and others ⚠️. Unregulated AI output, they caution, transforms into a **debt accelerator**. The community is proposing risk stratification and TDD (Test-Driven Development) safeguarding strategies. Agent pipelines, meanwhile, are introducing entirely new failure modes 😰.

It posits trading digital comfort for physical world progress. The [complete argumentation (AI News)](https://medium.com/@everbot/how-ai-might-have-just-saved-humanity-5f384d0c7c32) has sparked lively debate.

7.  **OpenClaw poses serious security risks.**
    OpenClaw, an Agent tool, poses serious security risks by granting LLMs local system permissions 💻. **Prompt injection**, it warns, could lead to account and data breaches. The community suggests physical isolation or layered execution for mitigation, but regulation and accountability are far from catching up with technology's spread. The [security analysis (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=47064470) is worth developers' attention.

4.  **Set up a full AI toolkit for a cousin.**
    An AI toolkit was set up for a cousin by Xiangyang Qiaomu, who practiced AI popularization during the New Year holiday. Their Windows computer was equipped with Claude Code and CC Switch, along with tools like Listenhub and Happycapy 🎓. The goal was to let family members experience advanced productivity. The [tool list (AI News)](https://x.com/vista8/status/2024269085446684870) is worth checking out.

5.  **Suno v5 vs. Gemini music generation comparison.**
    Suno v5's music generation capability far surpasses Gemini's, according to a comparison test by Xiangyang Qiaomu using the same prompts 🎤. **Suno v5** demonstrated much higher completeness and vocal quality, while Gemini could only generate 30-second clips with awkward Chinese vocals 😂. The significant difference was beyond expectation! The [comparison video (AI News)](https://x.com/vista8/status/2024264710313660758) makes it clear.
