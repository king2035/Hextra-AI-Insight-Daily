### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Fourier GR-3 Debuts at CES.**
    At CES 2026, Fourier showcased its 🔥[Humanoid Robot GR-3 (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/01/367659.html), offering attendees a hands-on experience in an interactive zone. This robot, the GR-3, is super agile thanks to its **55 degrees of freedom** across its body, and it can play chess, chat, and even 💡recognize expressions. Fourier designed it for **warm companionship**, using Morandi colors to soften its mechanical look. The company also unveiled a desktop doll robot concept prototype.

2.  **Xpeng's Second-Gen VLA Large Model Hits the Road.**
    Xpeng's second-generation VLA large model is set for mass production rollout in Q1, following He Xiaopeng's announcement that 🚀**Physical AI** will be the core keyword for 2026. This model can directly drive actions from visual input, boasting **entry-level L4 capabilities** (pretty cool, right?). Both the 2026 P7+ and G7 models will feature this tech, and Robotaxi operations are also slated to officially kick off 💡. Xpeng is also pushing to mass-produce humanoid robots and flying cars.

3.  **OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Health.**
    OpenAI officially launched [ChatGPT Health (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/openai-chatgpt-aa2635), which can connect to **Apple Health** and electronic health records 🏥. You can upload blood test reports, and it'll explain the indicators in plain language, plus generate a list of questions for your doctor (how handy!). Importantly, health data is stored independently and encrypted, **not used for model training**. Currently, it's only available for 💡a limited number of users in open testing.<br/>![AI News: ChatGPT Health Connecting to Health App Interface Demonstration](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kef3qx0ge8ttxagzvxv74saz.avif)<br/>

4.  **Google Classroom Launches Gemini Podcast Tool.**
    Google Classroom has rolled out a Gemini podcast tool, allowing teachers to input course topics and 🎙️ automatically generate [podcast-style audio lessons (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24387) specifically designed for Gen Z. It supports a **host + guest** conversational format and even lets you add background music 💡. One teacher reported student completion rates hitting **92%** (double that of reading PDFs!). With multi-language support and one-click generation, it's a real game-changer for bite-sized learning (awesome!).

5.  **Tencent Open-Sources HY-Motion 1.0.**
    Tencent Hunyuan has released 🔥[HY-Motion 1.0, a text-to-3D action large model (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24388), featuring **billions of parameters** and based on the DiT architecture. This model can generate over 200 action categories, covering everything from everyday walking to 💪sports competitions. Its output integrates directly with Unreal and Unity, making it plug-and-play (super cool!). The project has already been open-sourced on [HuggingFace (AI News)](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0).<br/>![AI News: HY-Motion Generated 3D Character Animation Effect Display](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kef3r1j2f0vvyfq3hybe7fv2.avif)<br/>

### Frontier Research

1.  **V-Agent Multimodal Video Search.**
    A new paper introduces the 🔍[V-Agent video search system (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16925), which allows fine-tuning VLMs to understand both visuals and speech simultaneously. Three agents collaborate 💡to process user intent, achieving **SOTA zero-shot performance** on the MultiVENT 2.0 test set. Video frames and speech-to-text are embedded in the same space (how clever!), and the model has been open-sourced.

2.  **PhysVideoGenerator: Physics-Aware Video Generation.**
    This paper introduces PhysVideoGenerator, a model that enables video generation models 🎬to [learn physical laws (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03665), addressing unnatural object collisions. It uses **V-JEPA2** to extract physical features and inject them into the generation process 💡, significantly improving gravity and temporal consistency. While currently in the concept verification stage, training stability has already been validated (pretty neat!).

3.  **ThinkRL-Edit: Reasoning-Based Image Editing.**
    A new framework called ThinkRL-Edit allows image editing models 🧠to [think before acting (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03467), using **chain-of-thought sampling** to explore multiple solutions. Unlike traditional methods that only randomize during denoising, ThinkRL-Edit starts exploring at the semantic level 💡. By replacing vague scoring with a binary checklist, it significantly outperforms previous work (impressive!).

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **MiniMax's Hong Kong IPO Grey Market Sees 15% Jump.**
    MiniMax, another 🔥large model company, has gone public following Zhipu AI, raising **HKD 4.189 billion** [MiniMax (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24420). Its grey market price peaked at HKD 199.8, pushing its market cap close to HKD 60 billion 💰. The funds will primarily go towards next-gen multimodal models and proprietary chips, signaling that domestic large models are entering a **value realization phase** (big moves!). Profitability pressures and international competition remain future challenges.

2.  **Ant Aifu's Monthly Active Users Skyrocket to 30 Million.**
    Ant Aifu's monthly active users surged from 15 million to 🚀[30 million users (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24410) in just one month, prompting OpenAI to quickly follow up with ChatGPT Health. Ant Aifu has integrated the entire chain from **consultation to diagnosis and treatment** 💡, connecting with 5,000 hospitals and ten major brand devices. ChatGPT Health, however, is still stuck in the information assistance stage (oof 😬). The divergent paths of AI health in China and the US are becoming quite clear.

3.  **Google Urgently Hires AI Quality Reviewers.**
    Google is grappling with a 🔥[search quality trust crisis (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24405), as AI overviews frequently hallucinate. The same question yielded wildly incorrect answers, ranging from **4 million to 70 million**, when asked twice (yikes 😬). Even more seriously, some medical advice provided lethal guidance 💡, and the job postings indirectly admit to functional flaws for the first time.

4.  **Malicious Chrome Extensions Steal AI Conversations.**
    Two 💀[malicious Chrome extensions (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24409) disguised as AI tools racked up over **900,000 downloads**. They specifically targeted ChatGPT and DeepSeek to steal chat histories, with one even earning a "Google Featured" badge (talk about sneaky 😠). These extensions regularly sent browsing URLs and sensitive keywords to remote servers but have since been taken down 💡.<br/>![AI News: Malicious Chrome Extension Disguise Interface Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kef3r8a2fxn80t9x470yrx10.avif)<br/>
