*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use our Service. It also lets You know about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

We use Your Personal Data to power and improve our Service. By using the Service, You're basically saying 'yes' to us collecting and using Your information as laid out in this Privacy Policy.

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Words capitalized in this document have meanings defined under the following conditions. These definitions carry the same weight whether they appear in singular or plural form.

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

-   **Account** means that unique account we whip up for You so You can get into our Service, or parts of it.

-   **Affiliate** means an entity that's got control, is controlled by, or is buddies with us under common control. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other voting securities for electing directors or other management bigwigs.

-   **Company** (You'll hear us say "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this doc) is none other than **hubtoday**.

-   **Cookies** are just tiny files a website pops onto Your computer, phone, or whatever device You're using. They're packed with stuff like Your browsing history on that site, plus a bunch of other purposes.

-   **Country** means: California, United States.

-   **Device** is pretty much anything You can use to get to the Service – think computers, phones, or even Your tablet.

-   **Personal Data**? That's any info linked to someone who's identified or can be identified.

-   **Service** means this very Website.

-   **Service Provider** means any person or company crunching data for us. Think of them as third-party helpers we bring in to make the Service run smoothly, offer it on our behalf, handle Service-related tasks, or help us figure out how You're using it.

-   **Usage Data** is the stuff we automatically collect. It's generated from You using the Service or from the Service's tech infrastructure itself (like how long You hung out on a certain page).

-   **Website**? That's **hubtoday**, which You can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

-   **You** means You, the individual using or accessing the Service. Or, if You're representing a company or other legal entity, then it means them.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When You're using our Service, we might ask You for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who You are. This "personally identifiable information" could be, but isn't limited to:

-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? We scoop that up automatically when You're using the Service.

This Usage Data might include Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), Your browser type and version, which pages You checked out on our Service, when You visited and for how long, unique identifiers for Your Device, and other techy diagnostic bits.

If You're accessing the Service from Your mobile Device, we might automatically grab some info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the kind of mobile Device You're rocking, Your mobile Device's unique ID, the IP address of Your mobile Device, Your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser You're using, unique Device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also snag any info Your browser sends our way whenever You visit our Service, or if You're checking it out on a mobile Device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're using Cookies and other similar tracking tech to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and to save certain information. These tracking tools include things like beacons, tags, and scripts – all designed to gather and track data, helping us fine-tune and analyze our Service. Here's a peek at what we use:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file that gets popped onto Your Device. You can totally tell Your browser to reject all Cookies or to alert You whenever one's being sent. But here's the catch: if You don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for You. So, unless You've tweaked Your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service will likely be using them.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (You might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These little guys let us, for instance, count who's visited certain pages or opened an email. They're also used for other website stats, like tracking how popular a section is or checking that our systems and servers are running smoothly.

Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on Your personal computer or mobile Device even after You're offline. Session Cookies? They vanish the second You close Your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the reasons we're about to lay out below:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for making sure You can get the services available on our Website and use all its cool features. They're like bouncers for Your account, helping us verify who You are and stopping any sneaky, fraudulent activity. If we didn't have these Cookies, we simply couldn't give You the services You're asking for – they're strictly for that!

-   **Cookies Policy / Acceptance of Cookies Notice**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are here to remember if You've already given us the green light to use cookies on the Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty handy! They help us remember the choices You make while using the Website – like keeping Your login info saved or remembering Your preferred language. The big idea here is to give You a smoother, more personalized experience, so You don't have to keep typing in Your preferences every single time You visit.

Want to know more about the Cookies we use and what Your options are? Just head over to our Cookies Policy or check out the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy.

### Use of Your Personal Data
Here's how the Company might use Your Personal Data:

-   **To power and maintain our Service**, and yes, that means keeping tabs on how our Service is being used.
-   **To manage Your Account**: This covers handling Your registration as a user of the Service. The Personal Data You hand over lets You tap into all the cool features only registered users get.
-   **For contract fulfillment**: This means making sure we develop, stick to, and carry out the purchase contract for any products, items, or services You've bought, or any other agreement You've made with us through the Service.
-   **To get in touch with You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other digital ways (like push notifications from our mobile app) to share updates or important info about the Service's functionalities, products, or any services You've signed up for. This includes security updates, whenever they're needed or make sense.
-   **To keep You in the loop**: We'll send You news, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering that are similar to what You've already bought or shown interest in – unless, of course, You tell us You're not into receiving that kind of stuff.
-   **To handle Your requests**: Basically, dealing with and managing any requests You send our way.
-   **For business handovers**: We might use Your info to check out or go through with a merger, sale, restructuring, reorganization, shutdown, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as an ongoing business or as part of a bankruptcy or similar situation, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets being moved.
-   **For other cool stuff**: We might also use Your info for other purposes, like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out how awesome our promos are, and generally sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and Your overall experience.

We might share Your personal info in these scenarios:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might share Your personal information with Service Providers who help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and get in touch with You.
-   **For business handovers**: We could share or transfer Your personal information during any talks or actual processes of a merger, selling off Company assets, financing, or another company acquiring all or part of our business.
-   **With Affiliates**: We might share Your information with our Affiliates. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Affiliates are basically our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture buddies, or other companies we control or are under common control with.
-   **With business partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share Your information to bring You certain products, services, or awesome promotions.
-   **With other users**: If You spill Your personal information or chat it up with other users in public areas, just know that everyone can see it, and it might even get shared outside the Service for the world to see.
-   **With Your go-ahead**: We might spill Your personal information for any other reason, but only if You give us the thumbs-up first! 👍

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto Your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use Your Personal Data as much as necessary to play by our legal obligations (like if the law says we have to), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

The Company will also keep Usage Data around for our own internal analysis. Generally, Usage Data doesn't stick around for long, unless it's being used to beef up our Service's security, make its features even better, or if we're legally required to hold onto it for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (yes, that includes Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's main offices and anywhere else our processing partners are chilling. This means Your information might jet off to and be stored on computers outside Your state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads-up: those places might have different data protection laws than where You are.

By giving Your thumbs-up to this Privacy Policy and then handing over Your information, You're basically agreeing to that transfer. Simple as that.

The Company promises to take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure Your data is handled safely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer Your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're super confident they have solid controls in place, especially when it comes to keeping Your data and other personal information secure.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the power to delete, or ask us to help You delete, any Personal Data we've collected about You.

Our Service might even let You zap some information about Yourself right from inside the Service itself.

You can update, change, or trash Your information anytime by logging into Your Account (if You've got one) and heading to the account settings where You manage Your personal deets. You can also just hit us up to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal information You've given us.

Just a heads-up though: sometimes we might need to hang onto certain information if we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, Your Personal Data might get moved around. We will totally give You a heads-up before Your Personal Data is transferred and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill Your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends a valid request our way.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also dish out Your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the Internet or storing it electronically is 100% foolproof. While we do our best to use industry-standard ways to protect Your Personal Data, we just can't promise it'll be absolutely, totally secure. We're doing our best, though! 🙏

## Children's Privacy
Our Service is not for anyone under the age of 13. Seriously, we don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from folks under 13. If You're a parent or guardian and realize Your child has handed over Personal Data to us, please get in touch. Should we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that information from our servers ASAP.

If we ever need Your consent as a legal reason to process Your information, and Your country says a parent's gotta agree, then we might just ask for Your parent's permission before we collect and use that information.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that take You to other websites we don't run. If You click on one of those third-party links, You'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend You check out the Privacy Policy of every single site You visit. Just a friendly warning! ⚠️

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. It's on them!

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then. If we do, we'll let You know about any changes by simply posting the fresh Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes kick in, we'll give You a heads-up via email and/or a clear notice on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We totally recommend You check this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates. Just remember, once changes hit this page, they're in effect!
