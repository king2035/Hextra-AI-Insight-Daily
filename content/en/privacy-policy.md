# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy outlines our game plan for how we collect, use, and spill the beans about your info when you're using our Service and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We're using your personal data to power up and polish our Service. By hopping on board and using the Service, you're giving us the nod to collect and use your info just as this Privacy Policy lays out.

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Heads up! 🧠 Words with a capital letter have meanings set out under these conditions. And hey, whether they're singular or plural, these definitions stick!

### Definitions
For the scoop on this Privacy Policy:

- **Account**? That's your unique access pass we whip up for you to get into our Service or some of its cool features.

- **Affiliate** is basically a company that calls the shots, gets called the shots by, or is in cahoots with another company. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the votes for the big bosses.

- **Company** (or "We", "Us", "Our" – you get the drift) means **hubtoday**. That's us! 😎

- **Cookies**? These are tiny files websites plant on your computer, phone, or any other gadget. They store tidbits like your browsing history on that site, among other things. 🍪

- **Country** means: California, USA. 🇺🇸

- **Device** is any gadget you use to tap into our Service, like your computer, phone, or trusty tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any info that screams "this person!" or "we can figure out who this person is!"

- **Service**? That's just our awesome Website.

- **Service Provider** is anyone, natural or legal, who crunches data for the Company. Think of them as the awesome third-party companies or individuals we hire to help run the Service, act on our behalf, or give us a hand analyzing how you're using it.

- **Usage Data** is the stuff we automatically collect—like data generated from you actually using the Service, or from the Service's infrastructure itself (think how long you lingered on a page).

- **Website**? That's **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You**! 👋 That's you—the awesome individual using our Service. Or, if you're a company or legal entity, it's you too!

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're hanging out with our Service, we might ask for a few bits of info that could help us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" could be things like, but totally not limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That stuff gets collected automatically as soon as you start using the Service.

So, what's in this Usage Data? It could be your device's Internet Protocol address (like its internet fingerprint), your browser type and version, which pages you checked out on our Service, when you visited, how long you lingered, your device's unique ID, and other techy diagnostic bits.

If you're tapping into our Service on your phone or tablet, we might automatically snag some info. This includes the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the mobile browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other handy diagnostic data.

And hey, your browser also sends us stuff whenever you visit our Service or access it on your mobile device—we might grab that too!

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're all about using Cookies and other clever tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and to tuck away some info. We use stuff like beacons, tags, and scripts to gather and follow data, all to make our Service even better and to figure out what's working. Our tech arsenal might include:

- **Cookies (aka Browser Cookies)**: Imagine a tiny file chillin' on your device—that's a Cookie! You can totally tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But just a heads-up, if you say no to Cookies, some parts of our Service might play hard to get. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject them, our Service is probably going to use Cookies.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). They let the Company, for instance, tally up how many folks have checked out certain pages or opened an email. They're also used for other cool website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or double-checking that our systems and servers are running smoothly.

So, Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" types. Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or phone even after you're offline. Session Cookies, though? They vanish as soon as you close your browser. Poof! 💨

We're rocking both Session and Persistent Cookies for the reasons we'll lay out right below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are crucial for hooking you up with the services available through the Website and letting you use some of its features. They help us double-check who you are and put a stop to any sketchy use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work, and we only use them to give you those specific services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have given their 'ok' to the use of cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website, like keeping your login deets or language preferences in mind. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a super personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you swing by the Website. ✨

### Use of Your Personal Data
So, the Company might use your Personal Data for these reasons:

- **To provide and keep our Service running smoothly**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This is all about handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you unlock all the cool features available to registered users. 🔓
- **To fulfill contracts**: This means setting up, sticking to, and delivering on the purchase contract for any products, goodies, or services you've snagged, or any other agreement you've got with us through the Service. ✅
- **To get in touch with you**: We might ping you via email, calls, texts, or other digital ways (like push notifications from our mobile app) with updates or info about features, products, or services you've signed up for. This includes important security updates, whenever it's necessary or just makes good sense. 💬
- **To give you the lowdown on news**: This includes special offers and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering. Think things similar to what you've already bought or asked about, unless you've told us to chill out and not send you such info. 🚀
- **To handle your requests**: We'll take care of and manage any requests you send our way. 🤝
- **For business shake-ups**: We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, split-up, revamp, reorganization, shutdown, or other sale or handover of some or all of our assets. This could be as part of our ongoing operations, or during bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar processes, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets getting transferred. 🔄
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for other purposes, like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promo campaigns are hitting the mark, and generally sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. ✨

We might share your personal info in these specific scenarios:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers to keep an eye on how our Service is used and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: If we're looking at a merger, selling off Company assets, getting financing, or another company is buying all or part of our biz, we might share or transfer your personal info during those talks or processes. 💼
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates. Don't worry, though—we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates mean our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture buddies, or other companies we control or that are in the same club as us. 🤝
- **With business partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info so they can hook you up with specific products, services, or cool promotions. 🎁
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up in public areas with other users, remember that info might be seen by everyone and could even be shared publicly outside the Service. Just a heads up! 👀
- **With your blessing**: We might spill your personal info for any other reason, but only if you give us your explicit "go for it!" 👍

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your data as much as needed to stick to our legal duties (like if the law says we gotta hold onto it), sort out any squabbles, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. ⚖️

The Company also keeps Usage Data handy for our internal brain-storming sessions. Generally, Usage Data doesn't stick around for too long, unless we're using it to beef up our Service's security, make it more awesome, or if the law tells us we have to hold onto it for a bit longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, including your Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's offices and wherever else the folks doing the processing hang out. This means your info might get shipped over to—and stored on—computers outside your state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads up that data protection laws there might be different from yours! 🌍

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and handing over your info, you're essentially saying 'yes' to that transfer. ✅

The Company is gonna pull out all the stops to make sure your data is handled securely and totally in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't be sending your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're super sure they've got adequate controls in place, especially when it comes to the security of your data and other personal info. No compromises! 🛡️

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to wipe out your Personal Data or ask us to lend a hand in deleting the info we've collected about you. Poof! 🪄

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right there from inside the app! How cool is that?

You can totally update, change, or delete your info anytime by just logging into your Account (if you've got one, of course!) and hitting up the account settings section where you can manage your personal stuff. Or, you can just shoot us a message to ask for access, corrections, or to delete any personal info you've given us. Your call! 📞

Just a quick heads-up, though: we might need to keep some info if we've got a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so. Can't always scrub everything! 😉

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get moved around. But don't sweat it—we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and falls under a different Privacy Policy. You'll be in the loop! 📢

#### Law enforcement
Heads up: in some rare cases, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) hit us with a valid request. It's not our first choice, but sometimes we gotta play by the rules. 👮

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also feel it's necessary to reveal your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's needed to:

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping your Personal Data safe and sound is a big deal to us! 🔒 But let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the Internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% bulletproof. We seriously hustle to use top-notch, commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, but we just can't promise it'll be absolutely, totally secure. It's the internet, folks!

## Children's Privacy
Alright, listen up: our Service isn't made for anyone under 13. We absolutely do *not* knowingly collect any personal info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your little one has given us Personal Data, please, *please* get in touch! 🙏 If we ever discover we've accidentally collected Personal Data from a kid under 13 without a parent's 'ok', we'll hit delete on that info from our servers faster than you can say 'cookies'!

If we gotta lean on consent as our legal reason for processing your info, and your country says a parent's 'yes' is a must, then we might just ask for that parental consent before we collect and use that info. Better safe than sorry! 🧑‍🧒

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that shoot you over to other websites we don't run. If you click on one of those third-party links, boom! You're off to their site. We seriously recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of *every* site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🔗

Just so you know, we don't have any say over—and take zero responsibility for—the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. They're on their own! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
Heads up! We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then. If we make any changes, we'll let you know by slapping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy! 📑

Before those changes officially kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a big, noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises! 🔔

We recommend you check out this Privacy Policy every so often to catch any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy go live the moment they're posted on this page. So, keep an eye out! 👀
