But hey, please note: we might need to hang onto certain information if we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might be transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

### Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us! But hey, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure.

Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.

If we discover we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your information, and your country requires parental consent, then we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.
