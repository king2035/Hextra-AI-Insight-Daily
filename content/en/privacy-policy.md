# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Service. It also informs you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

Your personal data is what we use to get this Service up and running, and to make it even better. By using the Service, you're basically saying, "Yep, I'm cool with you collecting and using my info according to this Privacy Policy!"

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Capitalized words? They've got specific meanings, folks, defined right here. And these definitions hold true whether they're singular or plural – no funny business!

### Definitions
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means your unique spot, set up just for you to dive into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate**? Think of it as a company that either runs the show, is run by the main company, or is in cahoots with it. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the voting shares, equity, or other securities that get to pick the big bosses.

- **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) is none other than **hubtoday**! 🚀

- **Cookies** are those tiny files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or whatever device you're using. They're basically little memory keepers, holding onto details like your browsing history on that site for a bunch of different reasons.

- **Country**? That's California, USA! 🇺🇸

- **Device** means anything you're using to tap into our Service – a computer, phone, or even your trusty tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any info that's tied to you, a specific person, or someone we can easily identify.

- **Service**? That's just a fancy word for this Website you're on right now.

- **Service Provider** is basically anyone (a person or another company) who helps us out by processing data for the Company. They're the third-party pros we bring in to make the Service run smoothly, offer services for us, or help us figure out how you're using it.

- **Usage Data** is the info that gets automatically collected when you're using our Service or when the Service's tech infrastructure is doing its thing. Think stuff like how long you hang out on a certain page. 📊

- **Website** is **hubtoday**, which you can check out at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You**? That's you, the person using or checking out our Service! Or, if you're doing this on behalf of a company or legal entity, then that's "You" too. Got it? 😉

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### What Kind of Data We Collect 🕵️‍♀️

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that could help us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" could be, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's automatically collected whenever you're cruising through our Service.

So, what's in this Usage Data? It could be things like your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), what kind of browser you're using (and its version), which pages you hit up on our Service, the exact time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique identifiers for your Device, and other diagnostic bits.

If you're hitting up our Service on your mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This could be, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. 📱

And hey, we might also scoop up info that your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether you're on a desktop or your mobile device.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies 🍪
We're totally using Cookies and other similar tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and to stash some info. We're talking beacons, tags, and scripts here – all aimed at collecting and tracking data to make our Service better and analyze its usage. Some of the tech we might be using includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: Picture a Cookie as a tiny file that lands on your Device. You totally have the power to tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's trying to sneak in. But heads up: if you're not cool with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. So, unless you've set your browser to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service will likely be using them.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company, for example, count how many folks have checked out those pages or opened an email. They're also used for other cool website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or just making sure our systems and servers are running smoothly.

So, Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session." Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you've gone offline. Session Cookies, though, vanish into thin air the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We're actually using both Session and Persistent Cookies for the reasons we're about to lay out for ya:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are, like, super vital for giving you the services available on our Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They're all about authenticating users and stopping any shady, fraudulent use of accounts. Seriously, without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work, and we *only* use them to give you those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty straightforward: they just let us know if you've already said "yes" to us using cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty handy! They let us remember the choices you make when you're cruising around the Website – stuff like your login details or what language you prefer. The whole point of these is to give you a more personalized vibe and save you the hassle of typing in your preferences every single time. 🙌

### Use of Your Personal Data
So, the Company might use Personal Data for these specific reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, that includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used. 👀
- **To manage Your Account**: This helps us handle your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you tap into all the cool features of the Service that are exclusive to registered users. ✨
- **For the performance of a contract**: This means we use it to get those purchase contracts (for products, items, or services you've bought) all set up, followed through, and fulfilled. Or, you know, any other contract you've got with us via the Service.
- **To contact You**: We'll hit you up via email, telephone calls, SMS, or other electronic communication (like push notifications from a mobile app!) to give you updates or important info about Service features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To keep you in the loop with news**, special offers, and general info about other awesome goods, services, and events we're offering. We'll send stuff similar to what you've already bought or shown interest in, unless you've told us you'd rather not get it. Your call!
- **To manage Your requests**: This is all about handling and sorting out any requests you send our way. We've got you! 👍
- **For business transfers**: If we're ever looking at a merger, selling off assets, restructuring, or going through any similar big business shuffle (even if it's part of a bankruptcy), we might use your info to evaluate or go through with it. In these scenarios, the Personal Data we hold about our Service users could be one of the assets changing hands.
- **For other purposes**: Yep, we might also use your info for other stuff, like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally just evaluating and supercharging our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always trying to get better! 🚀

Alright, so here are the situations where we *might* share your personal info:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and might even get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: During any talks or actual processes of a merger, selling off Company assets, getting financing, or another company buying all or part of our biz, we might share or transfer your personal info. It's just part of the deal, ya know?
- **With Affiliates**: We might pass your info along to our affiliates. If we do, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates are basically our parent company, any other smaller companies we own, joint venture buddies, or any other companies we're in control of or share control with.
- **With business partners**: We could share your info with our business partners. Why? So they can hook you up with certain products, services, or cool promotions. Win-win! 🎉
- **With other users**: Just a heads up: if you're sharing personal info or chilling in public areas and interacting with other users, that info could be seen by *everyone* and might even get splashed across the web externally. So, share wisely! 🌐
- **With Your consent**: And sometimes, if you give us the green light, we might spill your personal info for any other purpose you agree to. It's all about your permission! ✅

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as we *really* need it for the purposes we've outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data as much as required to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we gotta keep it), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

The Company also keeps Usage Data around for our internal analysis (we love digging into that stuff!). Typically, Usage Data doesn't stick around for long, unless it's being used to beef up our Service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally obliged to hang onto it for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, including your Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the folks involved in processing it are located. This means your info might get sent to and stored on computers outside your home state, province, or even country. Just a heads up: those places might have different data protection laws than where you are!

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and then sending us your info, you're essentially giving us the thumbs-up for that data transfer. 👍

The Company is gonna take *all* the reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and totally aligns with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we've got solid controls in place – and that includes top-notch security for your data and other personal info.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the power to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or you can ask us to lend a hand in getting it deleted. It's your data! 💪

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info directly from within the Service itself. Pretty neat, right?

You can totally update, change, or delete your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings section where you can manage your personal stuff. Or, you can just ping us directly to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal info you've given us. Easy peasy!

Just a quick heads-up though: we might need to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions 🤝
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up *before* your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement 🚨
In some situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) come knocking with a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Play by the legal rules
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Stop or investigate any potential funny business related to the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe and sound
- Steer clear of legal trouble

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a *huge* deal to us! 🛡️ But let's be real: no method of sending data over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts using commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it's *absolutely* safe.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service is *not* for anyone under 13 years old. We're totally not in the business of knowingly collecting personally identifiable info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us Personal Data, please, please get in touch! If we ever find out we've accidentally collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without getting parental consent, we'll quickly move to wipe that info from our servers. Kid safety first! 👶🚫

If we gotta rely on consent to process your info, and your country says a parent's got to give that "okay," then we might just need your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that take you to other websites we don't run. So, if you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be zapped right over to their site. We *highly* recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry!

Just so we're clear: we have *zero* control over, and take *no* responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. You're on your own once you click away! 😬

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might give our Privacy Policy a fresh look now and then. If we make any changes, we'll let you know by simply posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

We'll give you a heads-up *before* the changes actually kick in – expect an email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. And we'll totally update that "Last updated date" right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

So, it's a good idea to swing by and check this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates. Just know: any changes to this Privacy Policy become official the moment they hit this page.
