## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask for some personally identifiable info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets collected automatically when you're using the Service.

Usage Data can include your Device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), your browser type and version, which pages of our Service you hit up, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're checking out the Service on your mobile device, we might automatically grab certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, your mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you pop onto our Service, whether on desktop or mobile, we might also collect info your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and to stash some info. These tracking goodies include beacons, tags, and scripts. They help us gather and follow information, plus they let us boost and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file that lands on your Device. You can tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or to give you a nudge when one's about to be sent. Heads up though: if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work as smoothly. Our Service probably uses Cookies, unless you've adjusted your browser settings to give them the boot.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These cool little tools let the Company, for instance, count who's visited those pages or opened an email. They're also handy for other website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or double-checking system and server health.

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you go offline. Session Cookies, though, vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for giving you the services available on the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help confirm who users are and stop any funny business with accounts. Without 'em, the services you're asking for just can't happen, and we only use these Cookies to hook you up with those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies simply tell us if you've given the thumbs-up to using Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website – like keeping your login deets or language preference in mind. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized vibe and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you visit.

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and your options? Just hit up our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section in this Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for these purposes:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, including monitoring the usage of our Service.
- **To manage Your Account**: We use it to handle your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you tap into different features of the Service available to registered users.
- **For the performance of a contract**: To develop, comply with and undertake the purchase contract for the products, items or services you have purchased or any other contract with us through the Service.
- **To contact You**: We'll reach out via email, calls, texts, or other digital pings (like app notifications) to keep you in the loop about updates or info regarding features, products, or services you've signed up for, including security updates, when it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To provide You with news**, special offers and general information about other goods, services and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about unless You have opted not to receive such information.
- **To manage Your requests**: To attend and manage your requests to Us.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, split, restructure, reshuffle, shutdown, or other sale/transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as an ongoing business or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar processes, where your Personal Data (that we hold) would be one of the transferred assets.
- **For other purposes**: We might also use your info for things like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and to really boost our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share your personal information when these situations pop up:

- **With Service Providers**: We may share your personal information with Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service and to contact you.
- **For business transfers**: We may share or transfer your personal information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
- **With Affiliates**: We may share your information with our Affiliates, in which case we will require those Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that We control or that are under common control with Us.

- **With other users**: If you share personal info or just hang out and interact with other users in the public areas, that info might be seen by everyone and could even be shared publicly outside the Service.
- **With Your consent**: We may disclose Your personal information for any other purpose with Your consent.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as needed for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data as much as required to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we have to), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Typically, Usage Data doesn't stick around too long, unless it's being used to beef up our Service's security, improve its functions, or if we're legally required to keep it for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's main offices and anywhere else where the folks doing the processing are hanging out. This basically means your info could zip over to and be stored on computers outside your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be different from those of your jurisdiction.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're effectively saying "yes" to that transfer.

The Company will pull out all the stops, taking every reasonably necessary step to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we've got solid controls in place, especially when it comes to the security of your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete, or ask us to help you delete, the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap some info about yourself directly from within the Service.

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by just logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section where you manage your personal deets. You can also hit us up to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to hang onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law says so, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might disclose your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is needed to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a huge deal for us, but let's be honest: no method of sending data over the Internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% watertight. While we really try to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee it'll be absolutely secure.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. We don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we discover we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll promptly take steps to delete that info from our servers.

If we gotta lean on consent as a legal reason to process your info, and your country requires a parent's OK, we might ask for your parent's go-ahead before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites we don't run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.

We've got no control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by just posting the fresh Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before those changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a clear notice on our Service. Plus, we'll update the "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We suggest you peek at this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Any updates to this Privacy Policy go live the moment they're posted on this page.
