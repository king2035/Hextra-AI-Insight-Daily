# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy spills the beans on our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information when you use our Service. It also gives you the lowdown on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back. 😉

We use your personal data to power up and improve the Service. By hopping on board and using the Service, you're basically saying 'yep!' to our info collection and use as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 👍

## Getting Our Terms Straight

### Interpretation
Words with an initial capital letter? They've got meanings set under specific conditions. And guess what? These definitions stay the same whether they're singular or plural. Easy peasy! 😉

### Definitions
For the lowdown on this Privacy Policy, here's what we mean:

- **Account**? That's your unique spot created for you to get into our Service or some cool parts of it. Think of it as your personal login. 🔑

- **Affiliate** is basically a company buddy that controls, is controlled by, or shares control with us. 'Control' here means owning 50% or more of the voting shares, equity, or other securities. We're talking team players! 🤝

- **Company** (that's 'the Company,' 'We,' 'Us,' or 'Our' in this whole document) means **hubtoday**. That's us! 😊

- **Cookies** are those tiny files a website tucks onto your computer, phone, or any other device. They hold bits of your browsing history and do a bunch of other neat stuff. 🍪

- **Country**? That's California, USA! ☀️

- **Device** means anything you use to hop onto our Service, like your computer, phone, or even a digital tablet. 📱

- **Personal Data** is simply any info linked to an identified or identifiable person. That's you! 😉

- **Service**? That's just a fancy word for this Website you're on! 🌐

- **Service Provider** is anyone (a person or a company) who helps us process data for the Company. They're our trusty third-party helpers who facilitate the Service, perform related tasks, or assist us in figuring out how awesome our Service is doing. They're part of the crew! 🚀

- **Usage Data** is the info we automatically collect – it's generated either by you using the Service or from the Service's own infrastructure. Think of it as stats like how long you hang out on a page. 📊

- **Website** is **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. That's where all the magic happens! ✨

- **You** means... well, YOU! The awesome individual using or accessing our Service, or the company or legal entity you're representing. We're talking to you! 👋

## What Personal Data We Collect & How We Use It

### The Kinds of Data We Scoop Up

#### Personal Data
While you're cruising on our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or identify you. This 'personally identifiable information' could include, but isn't limited to: 👇

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's collected automatically, just by you using the Service. No fuss! ✨

This Usage Data might include goodies like your Device's IP address, browser type and version, which pages you visit on our Service, when and how long you hung out there, unique device IDs, and other diagnostic bits. It's all about understanding how you roll! 🧐

If you're accessing the Service from your mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This includes stuff like your mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. We're keeping tabs on how you connect! 📱

And hey, your browser also sends us some info whenever you visit our Service, whether you're on desktop or mobile. We collect that too! 📡

### Our Tracking Tech & What's Up With Cookies 🍪
We're all about using Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and to save a little info. Think of it as using beacons, tags, and scripts to collect data, improve things, and get a better grip on how our Service is doing. Our tech toolkit might include: 👇

- **Cookies (aka Browser Cookies)**: These are tiny files plopped onto your Device. You're the boss: you can tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or to warn you when one's coming your way. Just a heads-up, though – if you don't take 'em, some parts of our Service might not play nice. But unless you've set your browser to reject Cookies, expect our Service to use them. 🤷‍♀️
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). They help us, for instance, count how many users visited certain pages or opened an email and lend a hand with other website stats, like tracking how popular a section is or making sure our systems are running smoothly. ✨

Now, Cookies come in two flavors: 'Persistent' or 'Session.' Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or mobile device even when you're offline. Session Cookies, on the other hand, vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies** (The Must-Haves! 💪)
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Who manages them?**: Us, of course!
  - **Why we use them**: These Cookies are super important for giving you the services available on our Website and letting you use all its cool features. They're like the bouncers for user authentication and help prevent anyone from trying sketchy stuff with your account. Seriously, without these, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work, and we *only* use them for that purpose. They're the backbone!

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies** (Did You Say Yes? 🤝)
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Who manages them?**: Still Us!
  - **Why we use them**: These Cookies simply help us remember if you've already given the green light to using cookies on our Website. One-and-done! ✅

- **Functionality Cookies** (Making Things Smoother for You 😎)
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Who manages them?**: Yep, Us again!
  - **Why we use them**: These Cookies are all about making your experience better! They help us remember your choices when you're using the Website – like your login info or what language you prefer. The whole point is to give you a more personalized journey so you don't have to keep re-entering your preferences every single time. Smart, right? 🧠

Want the full scoop on the Cookies we use and your options? Just hop over to our Cookies Policy or check out the Cookies section right here in our Privacy Policy. We've got you covered! 📖

### What We Do With Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for these cool reasons: 👇

- **To keep our Service running smoothly and rocking**, which includes keeping an eye on how it's being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you access all the cool features available to registered users. Sweet! 😎
- **To fulfill our contracts**: This involves getting purchase contracts for products, items, or services you've bought (or any other contract with us via the Service) all set up, followed through, and completed. We're all about sticking to our agreements! 🤝
- **To get in touch with you**: We might ping you via email, calls, SMS, or other electronic goodies like app push notifications. This is for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for, including security updates, when it's necessary or just makes sense. We'll keep you in the loop! 📧📞
- **To send you the latest news**: We'll hook you up with news, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering. Think of it as similar to what you've already bought or checked out, unless you've told us you're not into that. 😉
- **To handle your requests**: We're here to process and manage any requests you throw our way. Your wish is our command (within reason, of course)! ✨
- **For business changes (like mergers)**: Your info might be used if we're evaluating or going through a merger, sale, restructuring, or any other kind of asset transfer. This could be as part of ongoing operations or in a bankruptcy scenario where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets changing hands. It's all about keeping things kosher during big business moves. 💼
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for things like crunching data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are hitting the mark, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience even better. We're always trying to level up! 🚀

Here's when we might share your personal info: 👇

- **With our Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and might even get in touch with you. Teamwork makes the dream work! 🤝
- **For those big business moves**: If we're talking merger, selling off Company assets, getting financing, or another company buying us out (partially or fully), your personal info might be shared or transferred during those negotiations or the actual deal. It's just part of the business world! 🎢
- **With our Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliate buddies. But don't sweat it – we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Our Affiliates are our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or any other companies we control or share control with. It's all family! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With our business partners**: We could share your info with our business partners. Why? So they can hook you up with some cool products, services, or promotions. More options for you! ✨
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or chatting it up in public areas with other users, just know that info might be seen by everyone and could even be out there for the public. So, share wisely! 🗣️
- **With your A-OK**: For any other reason, if you give us the green light (your consent), we might share your personal info. You're in charge! ✅

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as we need it for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your data as much as necessary to hit our legal obligations (like keeping data for compliance), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We play by the rules! ⚖️

The Company also holds onto Usage Data for our internal analysis (think of it as figuring out how to make things better behind the scenes 😉). Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter time. The only exceptions are if we use it to beef up our Service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally required to keep it for longer. Safety first! 🔒

### Where Your Personal Data Might Travel
Your info (including your Personal Data) gets processed right here at the Company's offices, and wherever else our processing partners are hanging out. So, heads up! This means your info might get transferred to and stored on computers outside your state, province, country, or even other governmental jurisdictions. Their data protection laws might be a bit different from yours. Just sayin'! 🌍

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're essentially giving us the thumbs-up for that transfer. So, you're on board! 👍

The Company will absolutely take all reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're sure there are rock-solid controls in place – including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. Your safety is key! 🔐

### Want Your Personal Data Gone? You Got It!
You totally have the right to delete or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your data, after all! 💪

Our Service might even let you zap some of your info right from inside the Service itself. How convenient is that? ✨

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by just logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings. That's where you can manage all your personal deets. Or, feel free to hit us up directly to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal info you've given us. We're here to help! 🛠️

Just a quick heads-up, though: we might need to hold onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so. Some things just have to stick around! 📚

### When We Might Share Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might be on the move too. We'll give you a heads-up before your data gets transferred and falls under a different Privacy Policy. No surprises! 🔔

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data. We gotta follow the rules! 🚔

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also share your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇
- Stick to legal obligations (we're law-abiding citizens! 👮‍♀️)
- Guard and defend the Company's rights or property
- Stop or investigate any sneaky wrongdoing tied to the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe and sound
- Steer clear of legal troubles

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe & Sound
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a BIG deal to us! 🔐 But let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the Internet or storing it electronically is 100% bulletproof. While we bust our humps using commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it's absolutely, totally, completely secure. We do our best, though! 😉

## Kiddo Privacy: A Big Deal for Us! 👶
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13, plain and simple. We're not intentionally collecting any personal info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you've found out your little one has given us Personal Data, please get in touch! If we discover we've accidentally collected data from someone under 13 without a parent's OK, we'll quickly boot that info off our servers. Kid safety is paramount! 🛡️

Now, if we need to get consent to process your info, and your country says a parent's gotta sign off on it, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Just making sure all our bases are covered! ✅

## Links to Other Cool (and not so cool) Sites! 🔗
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 🧐

Just so you know, we don't have any say over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. They're on their own! 🤷‍♀️

## What Happens When We Update This Privacy Policy
We might give this Privacy Policy a facelift now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the fresh new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy! ✨

Before any changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a big, noticeable announcement on our Service. Plus, we'll update that 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises, just clear communication! 🔔

We recommend you peek at this Privacy Policy every so often to catch any changes. Any tweaks to this policy become official the moment they're posted right here on this page. So stay tuned! 📖
